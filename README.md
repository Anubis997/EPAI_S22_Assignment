The system implements a hierarchical structure with Person as the base class, which is extended by Student, Professor, and Employee classes to represent different roles with their specific attributes and behaviors. The system demonstrates multiple inheritance through the StudentProfessor class, which combines the characteristics of both Student and Professor, while also showcasing proper method delegation and attribute management. A separate Location class using slots provides memory-efficient location tracking functionality, complementing the main person-based hierarchy while demonstrating different OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
